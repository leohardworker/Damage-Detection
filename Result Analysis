Project Objective:
This project aims to identify potential malfunctions or damages in machines or vehicles by analyzing deviations in their normal operating frequencies. 
Machines and vehicles typically operate at specific frequencies during normal conditions.

Utilization of Audio Files:
Audio files are utilized as the primary data source. Changes in these files often manifest as alterations in sound waves, indicating potential malfunctions or damages. 
These audio files are then compared with reference values stored in a database.

Database Comparison:
The reference values in the database represent the normal and healthy operating conditions of the machines or vehicles. 
Discrepancies between the audio files and these reference values are analyzed. Significant deviations in frequency suggest possible malfunctions or damages.

Mathematical Techniques and Algorithms:
Various mathematical techniques and algorithms are applied to process the audio files. 
These techniques are crucial for analyzing sound waves, extracting specific frequency components, and comparing the obtained data with the reference values.

Usage of Convergence Techniques:
Convergence techniques, mathematical methods for data analysis, are employed in this project. 
These methods enhance the meaningfulness of the data and facilitate a more in-depth understanding of the analyzed information.

Significance in Different Industries:
The concept of detecting malfunctions based on operating frequencies has widespread applications in diverse sectors such as industrial maintenance, automotive, energy production, and more. 
Establishing an early warning system through these techniques is essential to prevent severe damages or operational failures.

Careful Selection of Techniques:
The techniques and algorithms used in this project have been meticulously chosen to ensure accurate results and to establish a dependable early warning mechanism. 
The project emphasizes precision and reliability in identifying potential issues in machinery or vehicles.
