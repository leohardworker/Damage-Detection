In the project I developed, I worked on implementing the ability to detect damage using sound frequencies. This approach is known as 'acoustic damage detection' and utilizes sound waves to identify structural damages.

How It Works:

Transmission of Sound Waves: In the project, I used a specialized sound source to create sound waves.

Reflection and Absorption in the Structure: Sound waves are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted differently by various materials within the structure. Damaged areas exhibit distinct responses from normal areas.

Sound Sensors or Microphones: I employed sensitive sound sensors and microphones to measure the detected sound waves.

Data Analysis and Comparison: I analyzed and compared the collected data using computer programs. During this stage, I evaluated the differences in sound characteristics between normal and damaged areas.

Damage Detection: The analysis results were utilized to determine the location, type, and magnitude of potential damage within the structure. For instance, damages such as cracks or material weaknesses could be identified.

Advantages and Applications:

Inaccessibility: I applied this sound-based method in areas where visual inspection was not feasible or challenging, detecting damage accurately.

Swift and Accurate Results: When accurate sensors and analysis methods are employed, sound-based damage detection provides rapid and precise results.

Structural Integrity Monitoring: In the project, I developed this method for continuous monitoring of structures. I assisted in ensuring the continuous tracking of structural integrity in large infrastructure projects or industrial facilities.

In this project, I conducted comprehensive work both in terms of hardware and software to enhance the ability to detect damage using sound frequencies.
